ðŸ‘½ Hi, I'm Emmanuel Agbetor, a Mathematical Science student at the University of Ghana.

ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in gaining experience in tech and exploring the world of software engineering.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python and working towards becoming a full-stack developer.

ðŸ–¥I'm looking to collaborate on projects that align with my interests and help me grow as a developer.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me on GitHub or eeyramagbetor@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to music, and watching mind bending movies.
